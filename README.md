# Machine Learning Roadmap for Absolute Beginners

## Overview
This guide provides a **step-by-step** approach to learning Machine Learning (ML) from scratch. Follow each step, practice the exercises, and update this file as you progress.

## **Step: Learn Python Basics**
Machine Learning relies heavily on Python. Start with basic programming concepts.

### **What to Learn:**
- Variables, loops, conditionals (`if/else`).
- Functions and data structures (lists, dictionaries).
- Basic file I/O (reading/writing files).

### **Practice:**
- Solve problems on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

⏳ **Estimated Time:** 1–2 weeks

## **Step: Data Manipulation & Visualization**
Learn how to handle and visualize data using Python libraries.

### **Libraries to Learn:**
1. **pandas**: DataFrames, filtering, grouping, merging.
2. **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Creating bar charts, scatter plots.

### **Practice:**
- Load a CSV file (e.g., [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)) and analyze it

 2 weeks (parallel to coding practice)

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Skipping fundamentals** (Python/math).
2. **Not practicing enough**—ML is hands-on!
3. **Getting stuck on theory**—focus on applied learning.
