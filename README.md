# Machine Learning Roadmap for Absolute Beginners

## Overview
This guide provides a **step-by-step** approach to learning Machine Learning (ML) from scratch. Follow each step, practice the exercises, and update this file as you progress.

---
## **Step 1: Learn Python Basics**
Machine Learning relies heavily on Python. Start with basic programming concepts.

### **What to Learn:**
- Variables, loops, conditionals (`if/else`).
- Functions and data structures (lists, dictionaries).
- Basic file I/O (reading/writing files).

### **Practice:**
- Solve problems on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

‚è≥ **Estimated Time:** 1‚Äì2 weeks

---
## **Step 2: Data Manipulation & Visualization**
Learn how to handle and visualize data using Python libraries.

### **Libraries to Learn:**
1. **pandas**: DataFrames, filtering, grouping, merging.
2. **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Creating bar charts, scatter plots.

### **Practice:**
- Load a CSV file (e.g., [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)) and analyze it.

‚è≥ **Estimated Time:** 1 week

---
## **Step 3: Basic Math for ML**
A strong math foundation is essential for ML.

### **Topics to Cover:**
- **Statistics**: Mean, median, standard deviation.
- **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices.
- **Calculus**: Derivatives.

### **Resources:**
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) (free math courses)

‚è≥ **Estimated Time:** 2 weeks (parallel to coding practice)

---
## **Step 4: Your First ML Project**
Work on a simple ML project using `scikit-learn`.

### **Project Idea:** Predict Titanic survival.
1. Load data with `pandas`.
2. Clean data (handle missing values, convert text to numbers).
3. Train a model (`RandomForestClassifier`).
4. Evaluate accuracy.

## **Step 5: Learn Core Algorithms**
Understand how fundamental ML algorithms work.

### **Algorithms to Learn:**
1. **Linear Regression** (predict numbers)
2. **Logistic Regression** (predict yes/no)
3. **Decision Trees & Random Forests** (classification/regression)

üìñ **Resource:** [scikit-learn User Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)

‚è≥ **Estimated Time:** 1‚Äì2 weeks

---
## **Step 6: Deep Learning Basics**
Once you understand core ML, start with neural networks.

### **Tools to Learn:**
1. **TensorFlow/Keras** (Beginner-friendly deep learning framework)
2. **MNIST Dataset** (Classify handwritten digits)

üìå **Reference Code:** Available in `deep_learning_basics.ipynb`

‚è≥ **Estimated Time:** 2‚Äì3 weeks

---
## **Step 7: Keep Practicing!**
- **Kaggle**: Join competitions like [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) or [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
- **Projects**: Build a spam detector, movie recommendation system, or stock price predictor.

---
## **Key Tools to Install**
1. **Jupyter Notebook** (`pip install jupyter`)
2. **Anaconda** ([Download](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution))

---
## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Skipping fundamentals** (Python/math).
2. **Not practicing enough**‚ÄîML is hands-on!
3. **Getting stuck on theory**‚Äîfocus on applied learning.
